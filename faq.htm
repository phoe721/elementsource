        <p>
        Element Source Inc. now operates business from locations in CA. California residents living 
        within Los Angeles county will be charged 8.25%. If you live outside of Los Angeles county 
        but in the state of California, a 7.25% tax will be applied. UPS ships to Hawaii, Alaska 
        and Puerto Rico via UPS Ground, UPS 2nd Day and UPS Next Day Saver only. If you've selected
        any other UPS shipping method prior to choosing a shipping address in Hawaii, Alaska or 
        Puerto Rico, your shipping method will default to the cheapest available UPS shipping method 
        and you will be charged accordingly.

        <h2><a name="5">Can you ship to a different address than my billing?</a></h2>
        <p>
        Yes, we are able to ship to an address other than your billing address. 
        However, we do require an authorization, so that we can help cut down 
        on fraudulent usage of credit cards, that is currently so prevalent on 
        the internet. This one step helps us cut down on fraud, keeps our costs 
        down, and enables us to provide our customers with the lowest price possible. 
        The procedure is done strictly to protect consumers, as well as ourselves as 
        a merchant. We realize that this policy may be slightly inconvenient, however 
        it enables us to provide you with the best possible price. We hope you 
        understand our position, and thank you for your cooperation! 
        </p>
        <h2><a name="6">How can I cancel an order?</a></h2>
        <p>
        You may request a cancellation of your order, provided your order has not already 
        been processed and shipped. Simply call (626)-382-5995 during Element Source Inc.'s 
        hours of operation to request an order cancellation. We will do our very best to 
        cancel the order, and will send a confirmation upon cancellation. If your account 
        has already been charged, you can anticipate a refund to your account within 1-2 
        business days. We strongly discourage sending order cancellation requests via email 
        because it is unlikely we will receive the message in time to void the order due 
        to the sheer volume of emails we receive each day and for security purposes.
